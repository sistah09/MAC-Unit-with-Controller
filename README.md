# MAC-Unit-with-Controller
 8-bit Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit along with a controller that utilizes Block RAM (BRAM). The MAC unit is designed to multiply two 8-bit operands and accumulate the outcomes. BRAM functions as the storage medium for intermediate data throughout the computation process, while the controller oversees data flow and control signals.
